# vibrato-pitch
This contains the matlab source code for an experiment on perceived pitch of vibrato that I created for my psychophysics course.
Visit the corresponding [presentation](https://tamaracha.github.io/vibrato-pitch/presentation) (in german) for more details.

## Requirements
* Matlab or Octave
* [PsychToolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org)
* octave packages io and Dataframe

## Run
* Clone this repo to your machine
* cd to the experiment subdirectory in the local repo
