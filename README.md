# vibrato-pitch
This contains the matlab source code for an psychophysics experiment on perceived pitch of vibrato tones that I created for one of my university courses.
Visit the corresponding [presentation](https://tamaracha.github.io/vibrato-pitch/presentation) (in german) for explanations.

## Requirements
* Matlab or Octave
* [PsychToolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org)
* octave packages io and Dataframe

## Run
* Clone this repo locally
* cd to the experiment subdirectory in the local repo
* run octave-cli
* enter `experiment();`
* Procede through the presented trials, match the pitch of the straight tone to the vibrato tone using the arrow keys.
* After finishing, results are written to the data subdirectory.
